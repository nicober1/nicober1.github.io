        "cdata!": "This paper employs high frequency\n            transactions data on the world’s oldest and most extensive\n            centralized peer-to-peer Bitcoin market, which enables trade\n            in the currencies of more than 135 countries. It presents an\n            algorithm that allows, with high probability, the detection\n            of “crypto vehicle transactions” in which crypto currency is\n            used to move capital across borders or facilitate domestic\n            transactions. In contrast to previous work which has used\n            “on-chain” data, this paper’s approach enables one to\n            investigate parts of the vastly larger pool of “off-chain”\n            transactions. Finding that, as a conservative lower bound,\n            over 7 percent of the 45 million trades on the exchange we\n            explore represent crypto vehicle transactions in which\n            Bitcoin is used to make payments in fiat currency. Roughly\n            20 percent of these represent international capital\n            flight/flows/remittances. Although this work cannot be used\n            to put a price on cryptocurrencies, it provides the first\n            systematic quantitative evidence that the transactional use\n            of cryptocurrencies constitutes a fundamental component of\n            their value, at least under the current regulatory regime."

        "cdata!": "On-chain crypto-assets transaction\n            volumes have grown rapidly, particularly during the COVID-19\n            pandemic. Crypto-assets activity appears to be a global\n            phenomenon, although it still remains modest relative to\n            gross domestic product for most countries. Panel regressions\n            across more than 130 countries show that the variation in\n            countries’ monthly crypto volumes is mostly driven by\n            globally relevant factors such as real U.S. longer-term\n            inflation expectations, U.S. real Treasury yields, and gold\n            and crypto-asset prices, rather than recent country-level\n            macroeconomic developments. Cross-sectional regressions\n            offer tentative evidence that crypto activity is higher in\n            countries with higher information and communications\n            technology adoption and higher reliance on remittances.\n            Taken together, the findings shed new light on the drivers\n            behind crypto activity and offer support to the notions that\n            crypto-assets are perceived as a risk asset, a potential\n            macro hedge, and a potential tool to support cross-border\n            transactions. However, the results come with caveats: a\n            significant portion of the sample period includes\n            extraordinarily loose global financial conditions; the\n            crypto volume data have a short history, rely on important\n            limiting assumptions, and do not represent all crypto\n            activity; and crypto-assets represent a fast-evolving,\n            increasingly diverse asset class and industry."

Although the new players are\n            ramping up competition, pushing digital transformation and\n            exerting pressure on the global financial sector, their\n            services appear to be highly complementary to the ones\n            provided by the more established banks, which are also\n            embracing these technologies."
