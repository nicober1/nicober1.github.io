    "A team of astrophysicists and citizen scientists have identified what may be some of the final planets NASA’s retired Kepler observed during its nearly decade-long mission. They were found in the last data obtained as the telescope was running out of fuel. https://go.nasa.gov/3MEFSkw",
    "LIVE: Listen as we discuss the science aboard the next \n@SpaceX\n cargo mission set for Saturday, June 3, sending solar arrays, small satellites, and a plant experiment to the \n@Space_Station\n. Tag questions #AskNASA.",
    "\"Congratulations on an outstanding mission.\"\n\nThe crew of the \n@Space_Station\n shared their thanks and farewells after Axiom Mission 2 undocked from the orbiting lab at 11:05am ET (1505 UTC). #Ax2 is scheduled to splash down off the coast of Florida tonight: https://go.nasa.gov/3MK1kUW",
    "LIVE: The Axiom Mission 2 crew is heading home in \n@SpaceX\n's Dragon Freedom spacecraft after wrapping up the second all-private astronaut mission to the \n@Space_Station\n. #Ax2 undocking is scheduled for 11:05am ET (1505 UTC).",
    "#Ax2 is on its way to space!\n\nThe all-private astronaut mission lifted off from \n@NASAKennedy\n at 5:37pm ET (2137 UTC).",
    "Did you catch our latest \n@NASAArtemis\n Moon Minute in the Axiom-2 launch broadcast?\n\n\n@NASA\n and \n@Axiom_Space\n are working to prepare the suits that astronauts will wear when they land on the Moon for Artemis III.",
    "LIVE: Four private astronauts are heading to the \n@Space_Station\n for scientific research, student outreach and commercial activities on \n@Axiom_Space\n's #Ax2 mission.\n\nWatch with NASA, Axiom Space, and \n@SpaceX\n—liftoff is scheduled for 5:37pm ET (2137 UTC).",
    "We have final engine cutoff of \n@RocketLab\n's Curie engine on #RocketLikeAHurricane carrying two TROPICS CubeSats.  \n\nExpected Payload Deployment!   \n\nIt will take several orbits to confirm signal. Follow along for more mission updates! http://blogs.nasa.gov/smallsatellites/…",
    "Liftoff! Two TROPICS shoebox-sized satellites are on their way to join the fleet of \n@NASAEarth\n missions studying our home planet. Together, TROPICS will have the potential to gather near-hourly data on the formation and development of tropical cyclones.",
    "LIVE: Watch two small satellites for our storm tracking TROPICS mission launch to orbit. Liftoff on a \n@RocketLab\n Electron rocket is targeted at 9pm ET (0100 UTC May 8), with a two-hour window.",
    "Two storm-observing TROPICS small satellites lifted off on a \n@RocketLab\n Electron rocket, with two more to follow this month. This marks the first completed launch for a \n@NASA_LSP\n contract designed to increase access to space for science and tech missions. https://go.nasa.gov/44QozFo",
    "Two TROPICS CubeSats successfully deployed from a \n@RocketLab\n Electron rocket after launch. Signal acquisition from the pair of \n@NASAEarth\n small satellites may take some time to establish, which is not unexpected.\n\nWe'll provide confirmation when signal is acquired:… Show more",
    "NASA and \n@RocketLab\n are targeting 9pm ET Sunday, May 7 (0100 May 8 UTC), for the first launch of our cyclone-studying TROPICS CubeSats.\n\nTune in here and at http://nasa.gov/live at 8:40pm ET (0040 May 8 UTC) for live launch coverage from New Zealand: https://go.nasa.gov/42xYE3n",
    "A new habitat is prepped for volunteers to test living in Mars-like conditions for a year, \n@NASAWebb\n detects signs of water vapor on a distant planet, and we celebrate #BlackHoleWeek—that’s what’s up This Week at NASA. \n\nWrap up the celebration with us: https://go.nasa.gov/44B3u1j",
    "Live Now: The #Crew6 astronauts are relocating their \n@SpaceX\n Dragon spacecraft to a new docking port on the \n@Space_Station\n ahead of a cargo resupply mission. Undocking is scheduled for 7:10am ET (1110 UTC), with redocking targeted for 7:53am (1153 UTC).",
    "Today we mourn the passing of Samuel Durrance, an astronomer who flew aboard two \n@NASA\n Space Shuttle missions as a payload specialist and operated a collection of four telescopes as part of the Astro-1 and Astro-2 Spacelabs. Godspeed, Samuel.",
