OYO is a hospitality company that offers affordable accommodation options for travelers around the world. The company was founded in 2013 by Ritesh Agarwal, who was only 19 years old at the time. OYO is based in Gurgaon, India, and has operations in over 80 countries.

OYO operates on a franchise model, which means that it partners with independent hotels and guesthouses to provide them with branding, technology, and other support services. These hotels are then listed on OYO's website and mobile app, which allows travelers to book rooms directly with the hotels.

One of the key features of OYO is its focus on providing affordable accommodations for travelers. The company targets budget-conscious travelers who are looking for clean, comfortable rooms at reasonable prices. OYO also places a strong emphasis on quality control, ensuring that all of its partner hotels meet a minimum standard of cleanliness, safety, and hospitality.

In addition to its budget accommodations, OYO has also expanded into other areas of hospitality, such as co-living spaces and vacation rentals. The company has also launched a loyalty program, OYO Wizard, which offers discounts and other benefits to frequent travelers.

OYO has grown rapidly since its founding, with a valuation of over $10 billion as of 2021. However, the company has also faced some challenges and controversies, particularly around its business practices and treatment of hotel partners. In 2020, the company announced significant layoffs and restructuring in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a major impact on the hospitality industry.

Despite these challenges, OYO remains one of the most innovative and influential companies in the hospitality industry. Its focus on affordable accommodations and quality control has helped to reshape the budget travel market, and its expansion into other areas of hospitality suggests that the company has big ambitions for the future.
