Gucci is a luxury brand that is known for its high-end fashion products such as clothing, handbags, shoes, and accessories. Founded in Florence, Italy in 1921 by Guccio Gucci, the brand has since become a symbol of luxury and style around the world.

Gucci's iconic "GG" logo, which stands for "Guccio Gucci," has become one of the most recognizable symbols in the fashion industry. The brand is also known for its signature red and green stripes, which are often used as accents on their products.

Under the creative direction of Alessandro Michele since 2015, Gucci has experienced a significant resurgence in popularity. Michele's unique and eclectic style has brought a new energy to the brand, with a focus on bold prints, bright colors, and mixing different patterns and textures.

Gucci's commitment to sustainability is another aspect of the brand that has become increasingly important in recent years. The company has implemented a number of initiatives to reduce its environmental impact, including using more sustainable materials and reducing waste in its production processes.

In addition to its fashion products, Gucci has also expanded into other areas, such as fragrances, home decor, and even fine dining. The Gucci Garden, located in Florence, is a museum and restaurant that celebrates the brand's heritage and showcases its latest collections.
