Generative Pre-trained Transformer Version 3 (GPT-3)

Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Natural Language Processing (NLP).

In short, GPT-3 is a language model: a statistical model that calculates the probability distribution over a sequence of words. In other words, GPT-3 is a system for guessing which text comes next when text is given as an input.

## What exactly is GPT-3?

Although GPT-3 is a general-purpose NLP system, it really just does one thing: it predicts what comes next based on the text that is provided as input. But it turns out that, with the right architecture and enough data, this one thing can handle a stunning array of language processing tasks. GPT-3 is the third version of the GPT language model from OpenAI. So, although it started to become popular in the summer of 2020, the first version of GPT was announced 2 years earlier, and the following version, GPT-2, was announced in February 2019. But even though GPT-3 is the third version, the general system design and architecture hasn't changed much from GPT-2. There is one big difference, however, and that's the size of the dataset that was used for training. GPT-3 was trained with a massive dataset comprised of text from the internet, books, and other sources, containing roughly 57 billion words and 175 billion parameters. That's 10 times larger than GPT-2 and the next-largest language model. To put the model size into perspective, the average human might read, write, speak, and hear upward of a billion words in an entire lifetime. So, GPT-3 has been trained on an estimated 57 times the number of words most humans will ever process. The GPT-3 language model is massive, so it isn't something you'll be downloading and dabbling with on your laptop. But even if you could (which you can't because it's not available to download), it would cost millions of dollars in computing resources each time you wanted to build the model. This would put GPT-3 out of reach for most small companies and virtually all individuals if you had to rely on your own computer resource to use it. Thankfully, you don't. OpenAI makes GPT-3 available through an API that is both affordable and easy to use. So, anyone can use some of the most advanced AI ever created!

The text you pass in is referred to as a prompt, and the returned text is called a completion. A prompt is used by GPT-3 to determine how best to complete the task. In the simplest case, a prompt can provide a few words to get started with. For example, if the prompt was If today is Monday, tomorrow is, GPT-3 would likely respond with Tuesday, along with some additional text such as If today is Tuesday, tomorrow is Wednesday, and so on. This means that what you get out of GPT-3 depends on what you send to it.

### Different kinds of prompts

• Zero-shot prompts • One-shot prompts • Few-shot prompts

Davinci Davinci is the most capable model and can do anything that any other model can do, and much more—often with fewer instructions. Davinci is able to solve logic problems, determine cause and effect, understand the intent of text, produce creative content, explain character motives, and handle complex summarization tasks.

Curie Curie tries to balance power and speed. It can do anything that Ada or Babbage can do but it's also capable of handling more complex classification tasks and more nuanced tasks like summarization, sentiment analysis, chatbot applications, and Question and Answers.

Babbage Babbage is a bit more capable than Ada but not quite as performant. It can perform all the same tasks as Ada, but it can also handle a bit more involved classification tasks, and it's well suited for semantic search tasks that rank how well documents match a search query.

Ada Ada is usually the fastest model and least costly. It's best for less nuanced tasks—for example, parsing text, reformatting text, and simpler classification tasks. The more context you provide Ada, the better it will likely perform.
