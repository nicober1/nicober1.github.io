    "Interview with \n@BillMaher",
    "You asked (loudly), we listened.\n\nWe’ve reduced the signup flow for creators from 27 steps to just 4.\n\nIt’s never been easier to earn a living on Twitter. Tap on “Monetization” in settings to apply today.",
    "One-third of humanity remains offline, and many users only have basic connectivity.\n\nThe Ministry of Education in El Salvador—among many others around the world—is installing Starlink in schools to help close the digital divide ",
    "I am excited to welcome Linda Yaccarino as the new CEO of Twitter!\n\n\n@LindaYacc\n will focus primarily on business operations, while I focus on product design & new technology.\n\nLooking forward to working with Linda to transform this platform into X, the everything app.",
    "As seen by an unaffected third party",
    "First passenger rail service in the world to adopt Starlink! ",
    "Trust nothing, not even nothing",
    "[correction: \n@wsj\n trailed by several years]",
    "Remarkable how \n@nytimes\n, \n@latimes\n & \n@washingtonpost\n moved in lockstep, with \n@WSJ\n trailing by ~6 months",
    "Massive public manipulation",
    "WhatsApp cannot be trusted",
    "Governments worldwide claim that \"hate incidents\" are rising, but they're not. Tolerance of racial, sexual, and religious minorities has never been higher. Elites are manufacturing a fake \"hate\" crisis as a pretext for mass spying, blacklists, and censorship.",

    "The idea that governments around the world have for years been secretly censoring ordinary citizens sounds crazy, but it's true. Worse, they are now on the cusp of imposing what can only be described as a totalitarian system to end freedom of speech as we know it.",
    "Fairing reentry on the ViaSat-3 mission was the hottest and fastest we've ever attempted.  The fairings re-entered the atmosphere greater than 15x the speed of sound, creating a large trail of plasma in its wake",
    "Sorry our video upload is so bad! We’re working on major improvements. \n\nI recommend 480p for video longer than 10 mins, as that resolution is fine for phone/laptop users.",
    "The more screentime users spend looking at a post, whether text, pic or video, the more it is boosted. \n\nVideo posted natively to this platform will be boosted more than an external link, because way more time is spent watching a video than clicking on a link.",
