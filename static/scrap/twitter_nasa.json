    "Today is #Juneteenth, commemorating the day in 1865 when enslaved African Americans in Galveston, Texas were finally able to claim their freedom. In a conversation filmed at \n@SpaceCenterHou\n, \n@AstroVicGlover\n reflects on the holiday and its history.",
    "Forty years ago today, Sally Ride launched into history as the first U.S. woman to go to space. An astronaut, physicist, and educator, she inspired generations of women and girls to pursue careers in science and technology. https://go.nasa.gov/3NzVmHU",
    "In collaboration with \n@GoogleArts\n, \n@NASAGoddard\n scientist Dr. Heather Graham sits down with \n@Astro_Kobi\n to discuss how we find answers to the age-old question: Is there life beyond Earth?",
    "Why is Venus so hot?\n\nThe planet’s thick CO2-filled atmosphere is great at trapping heat. This creates a runaway greenhouse effect that makes Venus roughly 700°F (389°C) hotter than it would be otherwise. \n@NASAJPL\n's Dr. Amy Hofmann gives us the details: https://go.nasa.gov/42FxR4v",
    "Join us at 7:30am ET (1130 UTC) on June 15 for another spacewalk! \n@NASA_Astronauts\n Steve Bowen and \n@Astro_Woody\n will install another roll-out solar array on the \n@Space_Station\n, scheduled to start at 8:55am ET (1255 UTC).",
    "Suits are set to battery power and today's spacewalk is underway!\n\nThis is Hoburg's second spacewalk and Bowen's 10th—tying a record for most spacewalks made by a U.S. astronaut.",

    "My first EVA (Extravehicular Activity) was an incredible life experience. The team in mission control @NASA_Johnson was superb. The 1A power channel is now 10kW more powerful. Looking forward to doing it again this week.",
    "Teamwork makes the dream work! Researchers at @NASAAmes are creating tech to let small satellites work together—without being managed individually by mission controllers. One satellite swarm will fly this summer to test their work in our Starling mission. https://go.nasa.gov/45ZC5qF",
    "Dragon flies! \n@SpaceX\n's #CRS28 cargo launch lifted off from \n@NASAKennedy\n at 11:47am ET (1547 UTC). Learn more about the \n@ISS_Research\n it's sending to space: http://go.nasa.gov/43dcbOt",
    "LIVE: We're sending science—and a new set of unrolling solar arrays—to the \n@Space_Station\n!\n\n\n@SpaceX\n's uncrewed #CRS28 mission is scheduled to launch at 11:47am ET (1547 UTC), weather permitting. Watch with us.",
    "Today's #CRS28 cargo launch is being waved off due to high winds in the recovery area. \n\nMonday's launch attempt is scheduled for 11:47am ET (1547 UTC), with NASA TV coverage beginning at 11:15am ET (1515 UTC).",
    "NOW: An audio-only media briefing following today's public discussion on unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAPs.",
