    "Join us and \n@LibraryCongress\n as U.S. Poet Laureate Ada Limón reveals her poem for the \n@EuropaClipper\n mission. The poem will be engraved on the spacecraft, and travel 1.8 billion miles (2.89 billion kilometers) to an icy moon of Jupiter. \n\nTune in: https://bit.ly/42eJZJO",
    "I just reached a milestone only surpassed by Opportunity: 30 km on Mars   \n\nI've explored so much in my 10-plus-year trek through Gale Crater, but there are many more rocks to sample and analyze! Retrace my tracks with this interactive map: http://go.nasa.gov/3EtmSCi",
    "Hey, you: Get a load of this cloud! High-altitude ice clouds (like this one) can help regulate Earth's temperature by reflecting energy from the Sun.\n\nA new \n@NASAEarth\n mission called PoISIR aims to study them in greater detail to improve climate forecasts. https://go.nasa.gov/3IAfgjj",
    "Wow, Uranus is showing off more these days.\n \n\n@NASASolarSystem\n researchers found a polar cyclone on the gas giant for the first time. Microwave observations and the planet's particular orbit gave scientists a better view: https://go.nasa.gov/427AvQi",
    "A Progress cargo ship carrying food, fuel, and supplies for the \n@Space_Station\n is scheduled to lift off and dock on Wednesday, May 24. NASA TV coverage begins at 8:30am ET (1230 UTC): https://go.nasa.gov/3IBjfvZ",
    "Simply the best. Music legend Tina Turner sparkled across the stage and into millions of hearts as the Queen of Rock 'n' Roll. Her legacy will forever live among the stars.",
