The rings are made up of countless small particles of ice and rock, ranging in size from tiny grains to larger boulders. The rings are believed to be the remnants of a moon or other celestial body that was destroyed by Saturn's gravity or a collision with another object. The rings are not solid, but rather consist of countless individual pieces that orbit Saturn independently."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Saturn also has a strong magnetic field that is about 578 times more powerful than Earth's.
