Zwicky observed that the mass of galaxy clusters, as calculated from the movement of visible matter within them, was much lower than the mass required to hold the clusters together. He hypothesized that there must be some invisible matter that was providing the extra mass, and he called this substance "dunkle Materie," or dark matter.'),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Since then, many other observations have supported the existence of dark matter. For example, measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation, which is thought to be a remnant of the Big Bang, also suggest the presence of dark matter. And the way that galaxies rotate and move within galaxy clusters can only be explained by the presence of a massive invisible substance."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"So, what is dark matter made of? That's the big question, and we don't have a definitive answer yet. The leading hypothesis is that dark matter is made of weakly interacting massive particles, or WIMPs. These particles would be much heavier than electrons but much lighter than atoms, and they would interact very weakly with normal matter. This would make them difficult to detect, but they would still have a gravitational effect on visible matter."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Despite decades of searching, we have not yet directly detected WIMPs or any other form of dark matter. However, there are many ongoing experiments that are searching for them. Some experiments are looking for the particles themselves, while others are searching for the effects of dark matter interactions with normal matter."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Why is dark matter so important to our understanding of the universe? For one thing, it plays a crucial role in the evolution and structure of the universe. Without dark matter, galaxies would not have formed as they have, and the universe would look very different than it does today. Additionally, understanding dark matter could help us answer some of the biggest questions in physics, such as the nature of gravity and the properties of subatomic particles."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"In conclusion, dark matter is one of the most fascinating and mysterious phenomena in the universe.
