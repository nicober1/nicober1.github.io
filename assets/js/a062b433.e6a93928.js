While most of the planets in our solar system rotate on an axis that is roughly perpendicular to the plane of their orbit, Uranus is tilted at an angle of 98 degrees. This means that the planet appears to be rotating on its side, with its poles pointed almost directly at the sun."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"The cause of Uranus' unique axial tilt is still not fully understood, but it is thought to be the result of a collision with a large object early in the planet's history. This collision may have knocked the planet off its original axis and caused it to spin on its side."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Another interesting feature of Uranus is its atmosphere. The planet's outer layer is primarily composed of hydrogen, helium, and methane gas, which gives it its distinctive blue-green color. The methane in the atmosphere absorbs red light and reflects blue and green light, giving the planet its characteristic hue."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Uranus is also home to a number of moons, the largest of which is named Titania.

Its distinctive color and unusual rotational axis make it a unique object in our solar system, and its moons provide even more opportunities for exploration and discovery.
