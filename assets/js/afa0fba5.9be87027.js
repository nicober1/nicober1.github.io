When a star exhausts its nuclear fuel, it can no longer support its own weight, and the outer layers collapse inward.

The region around the singularity, called the event horizon, marks the boundary beyond which nothing can escape."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"There are several types of black holes, classified by their mass and other properties. The most common type is the stellar black hole, which forms from the collapse of a single massive star.
